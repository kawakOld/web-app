Welcome to Kawak!

Kawak aims to serve as a simple decentralized writing review tool. 

Users will be able to submit their draft which will be stored in a queue, once
the draft is submited, user will be asked to provide feedback of another essay. 

Further down the line Kawak aims to be meritocratic, meaning users who take the time to provide 
insightful feedback will be allocated with like minded peers. 

The quality of the tool will depend on the user. 

Trools will meet trools, busy bees will hopefully meet other busy bees. 

Data privacy is a key component as Kawak aims to store only the data that is core for the service to function. 
For this reason, services like AWS and Firebase are avoided.
